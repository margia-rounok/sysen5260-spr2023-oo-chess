# Retrospective

An integral component of the Agile software development technique is the
 retrospective, which emphasizes iterative and incremental development, 
 continuous feedback, and collaboration among team members. The retrospective is
 a dedicated time for the team to reflect on their recent work and identify
 opportunities for improvement. During this meeting, team members share their 
 experiences, successes, and challenges, and work together to identify areas 
 where they can improve their processes, communication, and teamwork. The 
 retrospective is a valuable tool  for promoting continuous improvement and 
 fostering a culture of learning and adaptability within the team. In this way, 
 the retrospective helps Agile teams to deliver high-quality software that 
 meets the requirements of the project in a timely and efficient manner.

## Collaboration

During our recent sprint, our team collaborated effectively to implement a
 terminal chess program. We started with a planning meeting where we discussed 
 the requirements of the assignment and broke down the work into smaller tasks. 
 Each team member took ownership of a specific task and we worked together to
 ensure that everyone had a clear understanding of the overall goal and 
 timeline. Due to the incremental design of the game, it was imperative that
 certain tasks (e.g creating the class definitions for each of the pieces)
 are completed before others. We priortized these tasks and assigned deadlines 
 so that the project can be completed in time.  

Throughout the sprint, we communicated regularly to ensure that we were on track
 and that any issues were addressed promptly. We also held a weekly stand-up 
 meeting where we shared progress updates and discussed any roadblocks or 
 challenges that needed to be resolved. This allowed us to pinpoint our
 individual progress and track our overall team progress and pivot when needed. 

## What Worked Well

Our task assignment enabled us to work on quasi-independent features. After
 writing the basic, necessary classes and game structure, we were able to
 complete more complex features simultaneously without fear of interfering
 with each other's work or past work. This increased our throughput, which
 positively impacted our productivity. We also were able to use each other's 
 expertise to the project's benefit. Those members that had more experience
 with programming handled the design and basic implementation of the game. Other
 members with more chess experience helped to write test cases and find
 interesting edge cases.
 
## Areas of Improvement

We also identified some areas where we could improve next time. One area
 where we struggled was in estimating the time needed for certain tasks. We 
 found that some tasks took longer than we initially anticipated, which caused 
 some delays in our overall timeline (e.g. checking for a potential check to 
 the current player's king). In the future, we could work on breaking 
 down tasks into smaller pieces and doing more thorough estimation to ensure 
 that we have a more accurate sense of how long each task will take.

Another area for improvement is in our testing and quality assurance processes.
 While we were able to deliver the feature on time, we did encounter some bugs 
 and issues that could have been caught earlier with more thorough testing. Next 
 time, we could work on incorporating more testing and quality checks into our 
 process to catch issues earlier and ensure that we are delivering a 
 high-quality product.
